# Ring-Oscillator-using-Cadence-Virtuoso
A ring oscillator consists of an odd number (5 or greater) of inverters connected in a loop. 
This project is to generate a layout of a ring oscillator using Cadence and perform a design rule check, to perform simulation to measure the frequency of oscillation of your design. Using this result we have determine the value of t for this 180nm process. 
The following observations were made:
1. How does t change as a function of temperature and supply voltage?
2. How does the frequency of oscillation change as a function of load capacitance on the output of the oscillator?

   The detailed report is attached in the PDF file along with the Cadence Virtuoso files for Layout and Schematic
